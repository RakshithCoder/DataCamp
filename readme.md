# DataCamp Notes
## What is **Machine Learning?**
* Set of tools to make **inferences,  predictions and find out patterns** from data.
## What Machine Learning **can do?**
* **Predict** future events
  * Will it rain tomorrow?
    * Yes
* **Infer** causes of events behaviour
    * Why does it rain?
        * Time of the year, temperature.
* **Patterns**
    * Different types of weather conditions.
        * Summer, winter.
## How does **ml work?**
* Learns patterns from existing data and applies it to new data.
* Like you can tell it what spam emails look like, later on it will detect new emails which are spam.
## Difference b/w **Data Science, AI and Machine Learning**
* AI is trying to make computers think like humans. Like:
    * Game playing algorithms
    * Self driving cars

* Data Science is making discoveries or trying to find meaning from data. Like:
    * Recommendation Systems
    * Forecasting

* Machine Learning is a subset of AI, which enables it to automatically improve itself through experience. 

* Deep Learning is a subset of AI, which specifically is concentrated on making machines think like humans.

## What is a **machine learning model?**
* Representation of a real-world process based on data.
* If we make a model based on historical traffic data, we can enter a future data into the model to predict how heavy traffic will be there tomorrow.
* Output can even be a probability of an outcome. Like probability of a tweet being fake.
